# Athena Tools

A set of tools to accomplish the following:

* CLI ORC file encoding
* ORC schema inference
* Lambda function that will encode S3 objects as Lambda from an S3 notification.


## ORC Encoding via AWS Lambda

The AWS prescribed method for encoding S3 data into an efficient data format for Athena is [awful](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/convert-to-columnar.html).
Rarely does one want the first instruction of anything to involve creating a Hadoop cluster.
